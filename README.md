A content based movie recommendation system  using cosine similarity which recommends movies on the basis of which user likes

# About the Project
MovieMetrix is a content based movie recommendation system this filtration strategy is based on the data provided about the items. The algorithm recommends products that are similar to the ones that a user has liked in the past. This similarity is computed from the data we have about the items as well as the userâ€™s past preferences.
This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations.

# Cosine similarity
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity
